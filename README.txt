Smart Loan Recovery System
======================================================

Objective
---------
To build an intelligent, data-driven system that helps financial institutions recover loans more efficiently by predicting the best recovery strategy for each borrower using machine learning.

The Real-World Problem
----------------------
Loan defaults are a major financial burden for lending institutions. Traditional recovery methods are often manual, reactive, and one-size-fits-all, leading to:
- Wasted time and legal expenses.
- Delayed interventions.
- Poor recovery rates.
- High dependency on subjective decision-making by recovery agents.

Our Approach
------------
1. Data-Driven Decision Making:
   - The system uses borrower profile data, loan information, payment history, and previous recovery actions to make informed decisions.

2. Predictive Modeling:
   - Built ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest) to classify borrowers by default risk and predict the most effective recovery strategy (e.g., follow-up, legal action, settlement).

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Created actionable features such as EMI-to-Income Ratio, Collateral Coverage, Missed Payment Flags, and Default Severity.

4. Clustering and Segmentation:
   - Used KMeans to segment borrowers based on risk and profile, enabling personalized recovery plans.

5. Legal Action Strategy:
   - Integrated logic to suggest legal escalation only when risk is high and no prior action has been taken, optimizing costs.

6. Streamlit Dashboard:
   - Built an interactive app where lenders can:
     • Input borrower details
     • Get real-time strategy suggestions
     • Visualize segment-wise loan portfolio insights
     • Track key metrics and model performance

Outcome
-------
- Improved recovery rates by targeting the right borrowers with the right strategy at the right time.
- Reduced legal and operational costs through smarter interventions.
- Enabled transparent and explainable AI for finance teams.
- Saved time for loan officers by automating strategy recommendations.

Ideal Users
-----------
- Banks
- NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies)
- Loan recovery agencies
- FinTech platforms

Future Scope
------------
- Add pre-default alert systems.
- Automate SMS/email reminders to borrowers.
- Introduce reinforcement learning for dynamic strategy improvement.
- Provide REST APIs for integration with enterprise tools.
